# Perspective Scaling

Perspective scaling is a method to recover frames between immersive panoramas by applying transformations to them based on their depth maps. This is the source code of a demonstration of this method. The perspective scaling procedure is implemented in the fragment shaders 'updateDM' and 'transformImage'.

See the demo in action on a synthetic scene [here,](http://www.agostbiro.com/ps/demo.html) or read more about the method, the challenges and possible improvements in the [paper.](http://www.agostbiro.com/ps/paper.html)
